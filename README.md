# Learning Outcomes
<h3>Project Handling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : I gained another valauble opportunity to model the project and lay out  steps in Notion before translating them to code.</li>
  <li>Insight : I realized that introducing any aspects outside of the project specifications (color design, animations, etc.) should only be done if I am willing to take <strong>full responsibility</strong> for their quality. Thus, I kept things minimal, outside the grid lighting up for each color mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : I was able to really dig in and make direct use of many concepts across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that were taught in the curriculum.</li>
  <li>Insight : I gained an experiential understanding of how I might use JavaScript in combination with HTML and CSS to build an interactive webpage.</li>
</ul>
